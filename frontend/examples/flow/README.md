# Anypixel-Flow
by Brad Bambara

An display where each pixel slowly rotates through the color spectrum. This example is built with the Anypixel Framework.

To build it:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

To run it, you'll need to install the [previewer app](#) first. Then in the app's root directory, do:
```sh   
preview
```
